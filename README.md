# Deploy to Arbitrary Git Repo

## Examples

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Add Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12.x
      - run: npm i -g yarn
      - run: yarn
      - run: yarn build
      - uses: thezzisu/git-repo-deploy-action@v0
        with:
          repo: ${{ secrets.REPO_WITH_TOKEN }}
```

### Using ssh

Use actions like [webfactory/ssh-agent](https://github.com/webfactory/ssh-agent)
to setup ssh agent. There's no need to reconfigure git-repo-deploy-action as
it'll use the default ssh push.
